# @capire/reviews

This is a sample app which provides a generic reuse service for managing reviews,
and a corresponding Fiori UI. It is used in the `bookstore` sample.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is just a sample, not intended for production use. It is meant to demonstrate how to create a CAP plugin and how to use it in your application. It is not optimized for performance or security.


### Reuse

```sh
npm add @capire/reviews
```

<details>
  <summary><i> Requires this in your .npmrc: </i></summary>

  ```java
  @capire:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
  ```
</details>


### Integrate

Instead of embedding it into your application, you can also run the app standalone,
and consume the service through OData.
